python / django image search


1. install django
    a. use "easy_install" install "pip", easy_install was already install on my mac (maybe a standard part of python?)
        sudo easy_install pip
    
    b. use "pip" to install "django", current version (at time of writing) is 1.4.2
        sudo pip install django

2. get the askdorotka code
    git clone git://github.com/ajm/askdorotka.git

3. cd askdorotka

4. download and extract the VOC 2007 dataset
    wget http://pascallin.ecs.soton.ac.uk/challenges/VOC/voc2007/VOCtest_06-Nov-2007.tar
    tar xf VOCtest_06-Nov-2007.tar

5. initialise the database of images
    ./initialise.sh VOCdevkit
    this command will ask if you want to set up a superuser account to the django server, just select "no" for now, I think it is easy to do later + askdorotka was not designed to be managed, you basically have to just kill the whole database and start over...
    go grab a coffee, this might take a while...

6. start the django server
    python manage.py runserver

7. in a web browser go to http://localhost:8000/start
